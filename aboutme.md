I am a full stack engineer whose passion lies in building great products while enabling others to perform their roles more effectively. 

I have led, architected and built horizontally scalable backends under SOA, REST, GraphQL and GRPC. On the frontend side, I have experience building applications with ReactJS & Flux architectures.

As a developer, I understand the code as a craft and I am always focused on writing high quality and clean code. I feel confident working with TDD and BDD but also identifying the best testing approach for any development.

My previous experience working as a QA & DevOps & Cloud Engineer helps me to be focused on creating great development environments and automating tasks to create the most suitable CI & CD workflows.
Regarding the Cloud technologies, I have experience with AWS, GCP, Kubernetes, Helm Charts, Docker, Swarm, Docker Compose to name a few.
As a Devops, Not only have I worked with automation tools such as Github Actions, Jenkins, Travis but also creating the infrastructure as a code with Ansible, Terraform and Cloud Formation.

Currently, I am enrolled in a Master in Artificial Intelligence and It is my desire to develop my career in this field. I can code in several programming languages such as Go, Java, NodeJS, Python, Groovy, Ruby among others and I really love the approach of functional languages such as Rust, Elixir or Erlang.
